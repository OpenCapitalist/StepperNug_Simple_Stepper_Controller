The StepperNug is designed specifically for Open Source Ecology.  What was desired is a modular system with motor controller being a component of the whole.  These controllers require step/direction/enable and all other command signals are input by DIP switches.  I am traveling to OSE this month to integrate the stepper controllers into their CNC Plasma cutter to finalize design requirements such as the limit switches and isolation.
